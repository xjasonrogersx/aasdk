    /**
     * @class TCPTransport
     * @brief Concrete ITransport implementation for network-based communication via TCP.
     *
     * TCPTransport provides Android Auto protocol communication over TCP sockets,
     * enabling wireless deployment and remote testing. Useful for:
     * - Wireless head units (Wi-Fi connected to phone)
     * - Simulator/emulator testing (localhost connections)
     * - Remote diagnostics and development
     *
     * Network Topology:
     * - Phone connects to accessory over Wi-Fi or cellular IP network
     * - TCP server listens on accessory (port configurable, typically 5037)
     * - Phone initiates connection; establishes secure tunnel
     * - Android Auto protocol frames flow over TCP (same as USB)
     *
     * Typical TCP connection flow (~500ms-2s latency due to network):
     *   T+0ms    [Phone joins Wi-Fi network, obtains accessory IP]
     *   T+100ms  Phone initiates TCP connect to accessory:5037
     *   T+200ms  Accessory accepts TCP connection; socket established
     *   T+300ms  TCPTransport created with socket handle
     *   T+400ms  receive(1024, promise) queued; TCP socket monitored
     *   T+600ms  [Phone sends auth message over TCP]
     *   T+800ms  TCPTransport.receiveHandler() invoked with message
     *   T+900ms  promise->resolve(authData)
     *   T+1000ms send(response, sendPromise) queued to TCP socket
     *   T+1200ms TCP driver transmits data
     *   T+1400ms sendHandler() confirms; sendPromise->resolve()
     *
     * Reliability: TCP provides retransmission and ordering guarantees;
     * packet loss is handled transparently by the kernel. Timeout on
     * receive/send indicates network disconnection or severe congestion.
     *
     * Wireless Considerations:
     * - Latency: 50-200ms typical (vs USB ~10-60ms)
     * - Bandwidth: Adequate for Android Auto (audio/video/nav streams)
     * - Stability: Depends on Wi-Fi signal strength and congestion
     * - Handoff: May disconnect if phone moves between networks
     *
     * Error Handling:
     * - If TCP connection drops (phone leaves Wi-Fi, router resets), stop() is called
     * - All pending promises are rejected with TRANSPORT_ERROR
     * - Application must restart discovery via network connection layer
     *
     * Thread Safety: Inherits from Transport base class. All operations
     * are async and serialised; safe to call from any thread.
