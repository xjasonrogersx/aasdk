     * @class USBTransport
     * @brief Concrete ITransport implementation for USB bulk transfer communication.
     *
     * USBTransport handles Android Open Accessory Protocol (AOAP) communication over
     * USB bulk endpoints. It manages the low-level USB transfers (send/receive) using
     * libusb, with configurable timeouts and error handling.
     *
     * AOAP Protocol Overview:
     * - Google vendor ID: 0x18D1
     * - Accessory mode product ID: 0x4EE1
     * - Standard accessory device provides IN/OUT bulk endpoints
     * - Messages are framed with 4-byte length header + payload
     * - Each transfer can carry multiple frames or partial frames
     *
     * Typical USB flow (single message lifecycle):
     *   T+0ms    receive(1024, promise) queued; USB IN endpoint monitored
     *   T+10ms   [Phone sends 100-byte message]
     *   T+15ms   USB driver receives data on IN endpoint
     *   T+20ms   USBTransport.receiveHandler() invoked with 100 bytes
     *   T+25ms   promise->resolve(100-byte data)
     *   T+30ms   send(50-byte response, sendPromise) called
     *   T+35ms   Data queued to USB OUT endpoint
     *   T+50ms   USB driver sends data
     *   T+55ms   sendHandler() invoked; 50 bytes confirmed sent
     *   T+60ms   sendPromise->resolve()
     *
     * Timeouts:
     * - Send timeout: 10 seconds (cSendTimeoutMs = 10000)
     * - Receive timeout: Infinite (cReceiveTimeoutMs = 0)
     *
     * Error Recovery:
     * - If USB transfer fails (cable unplugged, device reset), stop() is called
     * - All pending receive/send promises are rejected with TRANSPORT_ERROR
     * - Connection recovery is handled by application (reconnect via IUSBHub)
     *
     * Thread Safety: Inherits from Transport base class. All receive/send operations
     * are serialised; safe to call from any thread.
