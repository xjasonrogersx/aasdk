/**
 * @file Transport.cpp
 * @brief Base transport layer for frame-level communication with Android device.
 *
 * This implementation provides the low-level frame receive/send buffering:
 * - Manages receive buffer and distributes available data to waiting requests
 * - Queues send operations for transmission by subclass implementations
 * - Handles strand-based serialisation for thread-safe buffer access
 * - Provides size-based flow control (wait until N bytes available)
 *
 * Subclasses (USBTransport, TCPTransport) implement enqueueReceive/enqueueSend
 * to handle physical transmission (USB transfers, TCP sockets).
 *
 * Design: CircularBuffer holds received frames; receive() waits for N bytes
 * before resolving. Multiple receive operations can be pending with different
 * size requirements (e.g., one waiting for 4-byte header, another for 1024-byte
 * payload). sendQueue_ ensures sends complete before starting next one.
 *
 * Typical scenario (frame reception):
 *   1. Messenger calls receive(4) to read frame header
 *   2. Queued on receiveStrand_; check buffer - needs more data
 *   3. Call enqueueReceive(1500) to read from USB/TCP
 *   4. 1500 bytes arrive in receivedDataSink_
 *   5. receiveHandler() distributes: 4 bytes to header request, 1496 to next
 *   6. Header promise resolves; Messenger parses size field
 *   7. Messenger calls receive(size) for payload
 *   8. Payload data already in buffer; resolve immediately

     * @brief Queue a receive request for N bytes from the transport.
     *
     * This method asynchronously waits for the specified number of bytes to
     * become available in the receive buffer. When sufficient data is available,
     * the promise is resolved with that data. This enables size-based flow control
     * where the caller reads fixed-size headers first, then payload frames.
     *
     * Scenario: Receiving a frame from USB transport:
     *   - T+0ms: Messenger calls receive(4) for header size
     *   - T+0ms: Buffer empty; enqueueReceive(1500) dispatches to USB layer
     *   - T+0ms: USB bulk transfer scheduled to endpoint
     *   - T+15ms: 1500 bytes arrive; receiveHandler(1500) called
     *   - T+15ms: distributeReceivedData() checks: 4 bytes available for header
     *   - T+15ms: Promise resolved with 4-byte header
     *   - Messenger parses header, determines 512-byte payload follows
     *   - Messenger calls receive(512) for payload
     *   - T+15ms: distributeReceivedData() finds 1496 bytes in buffer
     *   - T+15ms: 512 bytes consumed, remaining 984 stay buffered
     *   - Next frame can be partially available before payload request arrives
     *
     * Thread Safety: All buffer operations dispatched to receiveStrand_.
     *
     * @param size Number of bytes to wait for before resolving promise
     * @param promise Promise that resolves when N bytes available, or rejects on error
